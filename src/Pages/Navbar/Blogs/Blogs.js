                <p><b>Ans:</b> <b>Node js:</b>Node.js is one of the most popular environments, taking the lead for the second consecutive year.Any project needs a programming environment and a runtime library that offers you basic programming tools/support and can compile and/or interpret your code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript programming language.  </p>

                <p><b>mongodb</b> MongoDB is a database engine. Code within some application or server uses MongoDB to save, query or update data sin a database. There are many web servers built with nodejs that will then use MongoDB for storing data.Suppose I am building a website and I need a database to store the data or information so here I can use MongoDB but to be connected with MongoDB </p>

                <p> <b>Ans:</b> JWT full meaning JSON Web Token.It is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties.What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.When it comes to APIs, JWTs are the standard. They offer a compact and safe method of information exchange without the need for a centralized token database.</p>
